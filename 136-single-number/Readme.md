Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:<br>

Input: nums = [2,2,1]<br>
Output: 1<br>
Example 2:<br>

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Example 3:<br>

Input: nums = [1]<br>
Output: 1<br>
 

Constraints:<br>

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4<br>
-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4<br>
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
